# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis

The Social Media Sentiment Analysis project is an insightful way to understand public opinion and engagement across social platforms. By analyzing attributes like Text, Sentiment, Timestamp, User, Platform, Hashtags, Retweets, Likes, Country, and specific time details (Year, Month, Day, Hour), this project reveals not only how people feel about certain topics or brands but also when and where these sentiments are most prominent. This knowledge is invaluable for brands looking to stay in touch with their audience’s emotions and reactions in real time.

# Project Overview

Data Preparation:
To improve analysis accuracy, text data undergoes cleaning, which involves removing irrelevant symbols, stop words, and applying lemmatization. By breaking down the Timestamp into finer details like Year, Month, Day, and Hour, we can capture how sentiments evolve over time and in response to specific events.
Exploratory Analysis:
By examining high-frequency hashtags, popular users, and common platforms, we get a clear picture of trending topics and influencer impact. We can also identify the most engaging content by looking at retweets and likes, and detect regional sentiment variations by analyzing data by Country.
Sentiment Modeling:
Sentiment classification models, including RandomForestClassifier, Naive Bayes, SVM,Logistic Regression DecisionTreeClassifier LSTM and Keras are applied to categorize posts into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. These models, trained on labeled text data, help capture the nuances of social media language and tone. Incorporating features like retweet and like counts gives additional insight into engagement patterns within each sentiment category.
Key Insights:
Visualizations offer an at-a-glance understanding of sentiment trends by hour, day, or month, and reveal shifts in engagement, trending hashtags, and regional sentiment patterns. The ability to track sentiment in real-time supports timely marketing adjustments and audience-responsive content creation.

# Project Impact
Through real-time sentiment tracking and deep engagement analysis, this project enables brands and marketers to stay attuned to their audience’s preferences and reactions. Whether launching a new product, responding to a crisis, or monitoring long-term brand reputation, these insights empower companies to be more proactive and audience-focused, ultimately driving better engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty.
